# arrow-erlang

Erlang implementation of the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) in-memory
columnar format.

As of right now, `arrow-erlang` only provides serialization (write) of Erlang
data structures into to Arrow. Support for deserialization (read) will be added
soon.

We provide support for the [Apache Arrow Columnar
Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#physical-memory-layout)
and the [Apache Arrow IPC
Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#serialization-and-interprocess-communication-ipc).
Support for [Flight RPC](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html),
[Flight SQL](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html), as well
conversion of Arrow into other formats like [Apache
Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/),
CSV and JSON is out of the scope of the project.

## Build

In addition to an Erlang installation, you will need a Rust installation with
`cargo`. You can then add the following to your rebar.config:

``` erlang
{arrow, {git, "https://github.com/Benjamin-Philip/arrow.git"}}
```

And compile!

    $ rebar3 compile

## Format Support

This implementation is still a work in progress. As mentioned earlier, we do not
have read functionality as of right now, only write.

We support the following primitive data types:

- Int 8/16/32/64
- UInt 8/16/32/64
- Float 32/64
- Fixed Size Binary
- Binary
- Large Binary

and the following nested data types:

- Fixed Size List
- List
- Large List

support for the other data types (both primitive and nested) will be added soon.

## IPC Format Support

Currently we support all the 3 "formats":

- Encapsulated Message Format
- Stream Format
- File Format

and the following message types:

- Schema
- RecordBatch

Support for the following will be added shortly:

- Buffer compression
- Endianness conversion
- Custom schema metadata

Support for the following will be added post v0.1.0:

- Dictionaries
- Replacement dictionaries
- Delta dictionaries
- Tensors
- Sparse Tensors
